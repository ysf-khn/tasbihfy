          <div className="space-y-4 text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Tasbihfy began with a simple but heartfelt request. A dear friend approached me about creating something special for his father - an elderly man who was deeply committed to his daily dhikr but struggled with traditional tasbih beads due to arthritis in his hands.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              "Could you make something digital?" he asked. "Something that would make it easier for my father to continue his spiritual practice without the physical strain."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              What started as a weekend project quickly became something much more meaningful. I watched as this simple app transformed not just my friend's father's daily routine, but also touched the lives of many others in our community who faced similar challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This is why Tasbihfy remains purposefully simple. In a world of complex apps with countless features, we believe that the most powerful tools are often the most straightforward ones. Every design decision has been made with one question in mind: "Will this help someone focus on their remembrance of Allah?"
            </p>
            
            <p>
              From that first conversation to today, our mission remains unchanged: to provide a beautiful, accessible, and distraction-free way for Muslims everywhere to maintain their spiritual practice, regardless of age, ability, or circumstance.
